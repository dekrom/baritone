A Minecraft pathfinder bot. This is a fork of [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone) by
[leijurv](https://github.com/leijurv), tracking the Fabric branches of
[MeteorDevelopment/baritone](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/baritone), with fixes aimed at the
one thing anarchy servers ask of a pathfinder: travelling a very long way, unattended, without
dying. Everything upstream Baritone does — `#goto`, `#mine`, `#follow`, `#build`, `#farm` — works
here unchanged.

Every fix lands on every supported Minecraft version, except the handful of bugs that only ever
existed on one of them.

Each Minecraft version has its own branch and its own release. Fabric only.

## Install

1. Grab the jar for your Minecraft version from [Releases](https://github.com/dekrom/baritone/releases).
   - `baritone-api-fabric-*.jar` — use this one if another mod (Meteor Client, an addon, your own
     mod) drives Baritone through its API. This is what most people want.
   - `baritone-standalone-fabric-*.jar` — everything exposed, for using Baritone on its own.
   - `baritone-unoptimized-fabric-*.jar` — not obfuscated. Use it when reporting a bug so the stack
     trace is readable.
2. Drop it in `mods/` next to Fabric API.
3. Type `#goto 1000 500` in chat.

Verify your download against `checksums.txt` on the release. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for anything
more involved, and [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) for the chat commands.

## What this fork changes

### Elytra

`#elytra` is the reason this fork exists. Upstream's implementation is good at flying a computed
path and bad at everything around it: getting into the air, and getting out of trouble once the
world stops matching the path.

- **Takeoff from anywhere.** `elytraAutoJump` only knew how to walk to an overhang and step off it.
  With no overhang in reach — most of the overworld, and most of a nether highway — it spent a
  couple of seconds pathfinding and then told you to go find a cliff. It now falls back to jumping
  on the spot, opening the elytra on the way up the way a vanilla double tap does, and lighting a
  firework the instant it opens. Three ways it could previously stand still forever are fixed as
  well, including landing at exactly y=31 in the nether, where the old fixed takeoff goal was
  already satisfied where you stood.
- **A survival fallback.** When the solver ran out of options it returned a heading with no pitch,
  which in practice means holding the last pitch straight into the terrain. That is exactly the
  case that matters: the world changed under the path, a wall appeared, something knocked you off
  course. It now simulates the pitch range and flies whatever trajectory stays clear the longest,
  preferring the one that ends higher, and forces a firework when nothing else buys enough time.
- **Physics that match the server.** The flight simulation had drifted from
  `LivingEntity.updateFallFlyingMovement`: hardcoded gravity instead of the `GRAVITY` attribute, no
  Slow Falling, a cosine term from `Mth`'s lookup table with a factor vanilla does not have, a
  missing divide-by-zero guard that produced `NaN` when looking straight up or down, and drag as
  `float` where vanilla uses `double`. Every tick of error compounds across the horizon the solver
  picks a pitch from.
- **Recalculating instead of hoping.** A path node buried in terrain used to be noticed and
  ignored. The segment is now recomputed, rejoining the existing path at the last node still in
  open air.
- **`elytraPathLookahead`** exposes how far ahead the solver looks for a node to aim at (was a
  hardcoded 20). Higher cuts corners harder at firework speed.
- **`elytraStandingTakeoff`** turns the standing takeoff on and off. On by default, capped at three
  attempts so a bad spot cannot burn a stack of rockets.
- **Cancelling could crash the client.** The nether pathfinder's native context was freed as soon
  as its own executors had drained, but a finished path calculation hands its result to the game
  thread, and that hand-off could still be sitting in the game thread's queue. Running it against
  freed memory is a segfault, not an exception. The context is freed on the game thread now, after
  everything else that touches it is gone, and every native call is fenced behind a flag that fails
  safe.

### Chunk cache

- Region files were rewritten in place, from the cache save thread, while everything else was
  reading them. A read that landed mid-rewrite got a truncated gzip stream and threw away a
  512×512 region's worth of cached terrain. Saves are written to a temp file and renamed over the
  old one, so a reader sees either the previous region or the new one.

### Pathfinding correctness

- Falls were charged one tick of gravity that never happens, because `velocity(0)` is zero.
- Descending onto a block counted one block of fall too many; the fall ends on top of the block.
- `GoalRunAway` folded its bounding box's max corner against the running minimum, so with more than
  one position the box collapsed towards the minimum corner.
- The dimension height check compared a y coordinate against a block count, letting the search
  climb 64 blocks above the overworld build limit.
- Waterlogged fences, walls, panes, bars, stairs and leaves were treated as plain water and walked
  into.
- `fullyPassable` listed the blocks you cannot jump through one at a time, so powder snow, honey,
  berry bushes, dripstone and anything in `blocksToAvoid` were considered jumpable. The hitbox is
  the same width in the air as on the ground.
- A diagonal's second corner was tested for lava but its magma check read the first corner again.
- `backtrackCostFavoringCoefficient` at 0 or below produced a non-positive action cost, which A\*
  rejects, failing the whole calculation instead of favoring nothing.
- `GoalGetToBlock` reported an ETA that never counted down to zero.

### Pathing thread

- `ToolSet` read the live inventory from the calculation thread — a data race with the game thread —
  and cached break speeds in a plain `HashMap`. The hotbar and selected slot are now snapshotted on
  construction and the cache is concurrent.
- `assumeWalkOnWater` was read off the settings mid-calculation, so flipping it made the cost
  function inconsistent with the nodes already expanded. It is read once per `BlockStateInterface`.
- `cancelRequested` is written by the game thread and read by the calculation thread, and was not
  `volatile`.
- `bestPathSoFar` allocated a `BetterBlockPos` per node on every tick a calculation was running,
  before the cheap checks that almost always decide the outcome; `PathExecutor` built a whole
  `CalculationContext` per tick to read two fields off it.

### 26.2 only

- Nether pathfinder chunk packing wrote solid sections as air, so `#elytra` planned paths straight
  through terrain. The 26.2 port had replaced the removed `LevelChunkSection.SECTION_SIZE` (4096,
  blocks per section) with a local `16`, and the all-solid fast path then memset 2 bytes instead of
  512.
- Baritone's threadpool threads are daemon threads. As of 26.2 the game waits on non-daemon threads
  at shutdown and files a crash report if any are still alive.
- 26.2 keeps one nether pathfinder context alive across engages and feeds it Baritone's own region
  cache, which is where the elytra freeze and the endless "Failed to compute path to destination"
  came from. Re-engaging blocked the game thread on the old context, which cannot be interrupted;
  and a region the pathfinder failed to parse is never retried, so one bad read poisoned every
  later calculation. The engage is deferred instead of blocking, and the context is discarded after
  three consecutive failures. The other branches build a fresh context per flight and are not
  affected.
- The above-build-limit fallback, which only exists on 26.2, divided by a horizontal distance of
  zero — making every step of a straight-up path `NaN` — and compared a squared distance against an
  unsquared 32.

## Building

Java 21 for the `1.21.x` branches, Java 25 for `26.x` (see the table above).

```sh
./gradlew build          # jars land in dist/, with checksums.txt
./gradlew test
```

Tagging `v<version>-<mc>` on a version branch builds it and publishes the release.

## API

The API is heavily documented. Anything outside the `baritone.api` package is not supported by the
API release jar.

```java
BaritoneAPI.getSettings().allowSprint.value = true;
BaritoneAPI.getSettings().primaryTimeoutMS.value = 2000L;
BaritoneAPI.getProvider().getPrimaryBaritone().getCustomGoalProcess().setGoalAndPath(new GoalXZ(10000, 20000));
```
